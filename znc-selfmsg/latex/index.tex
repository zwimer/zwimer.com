Many irc clients that can connect to znc are not \textquotesingle{}irc3.\+0 capable\textquotesingle{}. As such, they do not have the ability to recieve their own messages. This module fixes that issue, giving self-\/message capability to {\itshape all} clients that connect to znc. For more info, please go to the \href{https://github.com/zwimer/znc-selfmsg/wiki}{\tt wiki}

\subsection*{Disclaimer}

This application is written for znc 1.\+6.\+4. Unfortunatly, the functions required for this to work for private channels do not yet exist. They will however be implemented in 1.\+7. Once 1.\+7 has been released and is stable, adding private message support should be trivial but unil then this will only work for public buffers.

\subsection*{Requirements}

This module requires znc 1.\+6.\+4. To build the \href{#documentation}{\tt documentation} for this module, Doxygen 1.\+8.\+3 is required. For installation, it is {\itshape strongly recommended} you have znc-\/buildmod unless you wish to compile and link this manually.

\subsection*{Installation Instructions}

First clone this repository Then git clone this repository 
\begin{DoxyCode}
git clone https://github.com/zwimer/znc-selfmsg
\end{DoxyCode}


Next cd into it and call znc-\/buildmod on selfmsg.\+cpp 
\begin{DoxyCode}
cd znc-selfmsg 
znc-buildmod selfmsg.cpp
\end{DoxyCode}


Finally, relocate the .so file znc-\/buildmod created to znc\textquotesingle{}s modules folder 
\begin{DoxyCode}
mv ./selfmsg.so ~/.znc/modules
\end{DoxyCode}


If this fails because no modules folder exists in $\sim$/.znc, simply create it with 
\begin{DoxyCode}
mkdir ~/.znc/modules
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Usage}

To use this module either load it with /\+Load\+Mod or via webadmin. After that it should work.

\subsection*{Documentation}

Additional documentation to each component of self\+\_\+msg.\+cpp is provided via Doxygen. To generate this documentation, from the znc-\/selfmsg directory, run the following 
\begin{DoxyCode}
doxygen Doxyfile
\end{DoxyCode}


The documentation \textquotesingle{}index.\+html\textquotesingle{} is located within Documentation/html/
