// Body
Before as asked the question: How small can we make a (roughly square) matrix such that it cannot be perfectly solved via this algorithm? We eventually came to the conclusions that the smallest non-deterministic matrix for this was of size <span class="math inline">\( 4 \times 4 \)</span>.

Now another question: How small can we make a (roughly square) matrix such that it one: cannot be perfectly solved via the algorithm, and two: it's complement cannot be perfectly solved via the algorithm.

After altering the previous function, we ended up getting a square <span class="math inline">\( 5 \times 5 \)</span> matrix of rank 5.

<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
    1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
    1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}
