// Body
Last week I found myself wondering: What if I could approximate the integer programming problem with linear programming? To find out, I simply removed the constraint from <span class="math inline">\(A{\vec x}={\vec b}\)</span> that for <span class="math inline">\(x_i \in {\vec x}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_i \in \{ 0, 1 \}\)</span>. Doing so was a relaxation of this problem

Unfortunately, my luck with this was not very good. As it turned out, this approximation turned out to be fairly poor. While this function was approximate to solve each problem significantly faster, the errors given ended up being substantially larger. The following is done with each block size (see previous blogs) being the size of the image itself.
