After an initial meeting with professor Moorthy about what my study should be on, he suggested I brush up on SAT, the types of problem that can be generalized to SAT, along with a few different algorithms used to solve different reductions of SAT.

Professor Moorthy then recommended the book "The Art of Computer Programming Volume 4 Satisfiability Fascicle 6" by Donald E. Knuth. After quickly glancing through the book, I found a topic in it that stood out to me: digital tomography. Over the past few days I read the section on this topic, as well as on a few other of the problems to give myself a better understanding of this entire topic. From what problems can be generalized to SAT, how different problems can be generalized to SAT, to quite a few different algorithms to solve different SAT reductions, I read few a few different sections of the book to learn more about the topic in general.
