Unfortunately, integer programming, what we used to solve this digital tomography problem, reduces to SAT and thus is NP-complete. This means that my solver cannot be constrained by a polynomial function...

This fact is all too evident unfortunately. For a 30x30 pixel image, the solver takes under a second. For a 60x60 pixel image, the solver generally takes a couple seconds. As for an 80x80 image however, sadly this can take much longer... Over an hour long. But out of curiosity, I must ask: what if we were to approximate our IP problem with a linear programming problem?
